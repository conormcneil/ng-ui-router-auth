## Angular JWT App

This app is designed to demonstrate route-based authentication & authorization within Angular.js and ui-Router.

As a demo, the app consists of two users; an admin and a user.

The user has access to public routes but not 'admin' routes.

The admin has access to all routes.



To implement this app, fork & clone this repo, then:

```shell
$ npm install
```
